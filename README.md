 - Thirukkural is considered to be the world's greatest work on ethics and morality gifted by the Tamilians.
 - Written by the poetic saint <b>திருவள்ளுவர்</b>.
 - It is the collection of 1330 two-lined poems, each of which shows the path to integrity, non-violence and knowledge.
 - It is divided into 133 sections called "<b>அதிகாரம்</b>" and each has 10 poems(obviously) called "<b>குறள்</b>".
 - I have designed an API with Cloud Functions that returns the poem, explanation only in <b>தமிழ்</b> for a given Kural Number.
